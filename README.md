<p>Hello, my name is Germell Hosch. I am a recent graduate of Aurora University and currently seeking a web developer position. Here you will find a work in progress build for a personal website. This project currently consists of technologies such as NodeJs and the ExpressJS framework. While executing node commands may be quite repetitive, the utilization of Nodemon (a Command-Line Interface Utility)  is an efficient way to develop Node applications without needing to manually process and save the file system. I take advantage of this tool as I construct each testing web page into a fully launched website.</p>
<br>

<p>Running Node Application:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open terminal</li>
    <li>Locate the project directory containing "app.js"</li>
    <li>Enter "npm start" while in project directory</li>
    <li>Open preferred Browser</li>
    <li>Search "localhost:4000"</li>
</ol>
